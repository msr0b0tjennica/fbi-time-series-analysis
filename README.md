Time Series Forecasting - FBI Crime Investigation

Project Overview

The FBI Crime Investigation Project leverages time-series forecasting techniques to predict crime incidents in urban areas. The project aims to provide law enforcement agencies with predictive insights to optimize resource allocation, improve public safety, and implement proactive measures to prevent crime. The model estimates crime occurrences based on historical data, allowing for better strategic planning and intervention.

Business Context

Urban centers in the United States face increasing crime rates and complex crime patterns. Law enforcement agencies require data-driven solutions to predict and mitigate criminal activities. This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate the number of crime incidents based on historical trends, geographical locations, crime types, and temporal factors.

By identifying high-risk periods and locations, authorities can optimize patrol schedules, allocate personnel effectively, and enhance public safety measures. Additionally, insights from the model can be used for urban planning, policymaking, and emergency response strategies.

Objectives

Forecast crime incidents on a monthly and hourly basis.

Analyze spatial and temporal crime trends.

Optimize law enforcement resource allocation.

Provide actionable insights for policymakers and urban planners.

Data Sources

The dataset used includes:

Crime incident reports (historical records from various locations).

Geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude of crime occurrences).

Temporal data (timestamps, day, month, year, and seasonal trends).

Additional features (crime category, neighborhood details, external factors like events or weather conditions).

Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values.

Converting categorical variables into numerical representations.

Feature engineering (lag features, rolling statistics, time-based features).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residuals).

Visualization of crime patterns over time.

Correlation analysis between crime and external factors.

3. Model Selection & Training

Baseline Models: ARIMA, SARIMA.

Machine Learning Models: XGBoost, Random Forest.

Deep Learning Models: LSTMs, GRUs, Transformer-based models.

4. Model Evaluation

Train-test split using time-based validation.

Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, RÂ² score.

Residual analysis for error distribution.

5. Deployment & Visualization

Dashboard for interactive crime forecasting (Power BI, Streamlit, or Flask API).

Crime heatmaps using GeoPandas and Folium.

Forecasting crime rates for specific timeframes and locations.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, GeoPandas, Folium



How to Run the Project

Results & Insights

The model successfully identifies crime trends and high-risk areas.

Seasonal patterns are evident (e.g., higher crime rates during weekends or specific months).

Law enforcement agencies can use insights to enhance patrol scheduling and crime prevention strategies.

Future Scope

Integrate real-time data streaming for continuous forecasting.

Incorporate external factors like socioeconomic conditions, major events, and public policies.

Improve prediction accuracy with ensemble models and advanced deep learning architectures.
